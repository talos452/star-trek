# star-trek
A Star Trek mod for Minecraft.

To DOWNLOAD the mod, click the jar file in the top directory and then click the Raw button.

If you want to CONTRIBUTE textures or other resources, contact me and I'll add you as a collaborator and explain how to do it.

FOR COLLABORATORS

If you are adding ITEM or BLOCK textures: they go under main/resources/startrekmod/textures/item or main/resources/startrekmod/textures/block

If you are adding ENTITIES, there are two files you need to include:

* The texture file (should end in .png) goes under main/resources/startrekmod/textures/entity
* The Techne file (optional, should end in .tcn) goes under main/resources/startrekmod/textures/techne

I will generate the Model.java file for myself once you add the Techne file.
